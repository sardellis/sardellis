## Difficulties when migrating a blog


While migrating the blog from the Encredible Edibles site to Square, we encountered a number of specific issues. Most of them are caused by limited editing capabilities on the new platform. But there are isolated issues that we can deal with without resorting to Square tech support.

Pictures

The essence of the problem: you can not put pictures inside the article. Only one is allowed - capital.
Problem frequency: per article. Especially critical for articles with product lists.
Example: https://blog.incredibleedibles.com/best-cbd-lollipops/

### Numbering
The essence of the problem: on a new site, numbering only works if each paragraph starts directly with the next paragraph. If there are several paragraphs in one paragraph, then the system does not give the next serial number after several paragraphs. Even if you turn off the "auto numbering" button, it still puts "1. ... "and is not corrected.
We get around this issue by not having spaces between the paragraph number and the text, which looks ugly, or by removing the numbering altogether.
Frequency of the problem: about every 10th article.

### Table of contents

The essence of the problem: on the Encredible Edibles website, it was possible to make links within the article to the necessary sections - in this way we created a clickable table of contents. The new platform does not provide such an opportunity.
Problem frequency: about every 5th article.
Example: https://blog.incredibleedibles.com/cbd-effects/

### Video
The essence of the problem: there is no way to embed a video
Problem frequency: one video out of all

### Fonts
The essence of the problem: the editor on Square has text styles. Including Title. But not only the selected fragment changes, but the entire article as a whole. This happens even if you paste the text in parts.

Subheadings can only be in bold, which is not very revealing. There is no ability to change the text size at all, so it is impossible to make subheadings of several levels.

Problem frequency: all articles

### Image quality
The essence of the problem: some articles in the blog are illustrated with poor quality pictures, which is why the image is very floating. Plus, vertical images look extremely unfortunate on the desktop.
Problem frequency: about a dozen articles
Example: https://blog.incredibleedibles.com/find-cbd-oil-near-me/

### Links
The essence of the problem: after the publication of articles on the Square platform, it will be necessary to cross-reference each other in the articles, as was the case on Encredible Edibles.

Problem frequency: in almost every article
